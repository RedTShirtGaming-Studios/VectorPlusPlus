--- Vector++ ---

Hello!

Thank you for downloading Vector++.

Vector++ adds some more Vectors to Unity to make storing numbers easier. If you have ever used Vector3s you will know that they are handy.
If you use this in your game, you don't need to credit me/this project but spreading the word of this asset is appreciated.

--- ADDING VECTORS ---

If the extra vectors that I addedaren't big enough, this litle document will show you how to add
your own.

1. Make a new c# script - Make a new script and call it Vector[the largest vector +1] e.g Vector9
2. Remove the two methods and Monobehaviour
3. Add [System.Serializable] to the top of the script under the using tags
4. Add as many floats as you want with what ever name you want
5. Save and go into Unity
6. In a script, like the DemoScript provided, add 'public Vector9 newVector9'
7. Save that script and go back into Unity.

Congrats! You added your own Vector to Vector++.
